ADVERTISMENT FOR  ONE CONSULTANT ON CONTRACTUAL BASIS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE UNDER NATIONAL MISSION FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE (NMSA)
National Mission For Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)
Sustaining agricultural productivity depends on quality and availability of natural
                resources like soil and water. Agricultural growth can be sustained by promoting
                conservation and sustainable use of these scarce natural resources through appropriate
                location specific measures. Indian agriculture remains predominantly rainfed covering
                about 60% of the country’s net sown area and accounts for 40% of the total food
                production. Thus, conservation of natural resources in conjunction with development
                of rainfed agriculture holds the key to meet burgeoning demands for food grain in
                the country. Towards this end, National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)
                has been formulated for enhancing agricultural productivity especially in rainfed
                areas focusing on integrated farming, water use efficiency, soil health management
                and synergizing resource conservation.
NMSA derives its mandate from Sustainable Agriculture Mission which is one of the
                eight Missions outlined under National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). The
                strategies and programmers of actions (POA) outlined in the Mission Document, that
                was accorded ‘in principle’ approval by Prime Minister’s Council on Climate Change
                (PMCCC) on 23.09.2010,aim at promoting sustainable agriculture through a series
                of adaptation measures focusing on ten key dimensions encompassing Indian agriculture
                namely; ‘Improved crop seeds, livestock and fish cultures’, ‘Water Use Efficiency’,
                ‘Pest Management’, ‘Improved Farm Practices’, ‘Nutrient Management’, ‘Agricultural
                insurance’, ‘Credit support’, ‘Markets’, ‘Access to Information’ and ‘Livelihood
                diversification’. During XII Five Year Plan, these measures are being embedded and
                mainstreamed onto ongoing/proposed Missions/ programmes / Schemes of Dept. of Agriculture
                & Cooperation (DAC&FW) through a process of restructuring and convergence. NMSA architecture
                has been designed by converging, consolidating and subsuming all ongoing as well
                as newly proposed activities/programmes related to sustainable agriculture with
                a special emphasis on soil & water conservation, water use efficiency, soil health
                management and rainfed area development. The focus of NMSA will be to infuse the
                judicious utilization of resources of commons through community based approach.
NMSA will cater to key dimensions of ‘Water use efficiency’, ‘Nutrient Management’
                and ‘Livelihood diversification’ through adoption of sustainable development pathway
                by progressively shifting to environmental friendly technologies, adoption of energy
                efficient equipments, conservation of natural resources, integrated farming, etc.
                Besides, NMSA aims at promoting location specific improved agronomic practices through
                soil health management, enhanced water use efficiency, judicious use of chemicals,
                crop diversification, progressive adoption of crop-livestock farming systems and
                integrated approaches like crop-sericulture, agro-forestry, fish farming, etc.
