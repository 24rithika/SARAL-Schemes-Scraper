Designating NIC Headquarter as global AUA for implementation of IM PDS scheme.
the new Central Sector Scheme, IM-PDS aims at facilitating national level portability and de-duplication of ration cards. As per the UIDAIguidelines, eachAUAwill generate a token number against every Aadhaar number, which will be specific to the AUAof the scheme/programme. Since token number only has to be used for
the biometric authentication of the beneficiaries, it is critical to the implementation of the IM-PDSthat there is a unique token number for every Aadhaar number seeded with ration card at the national level. The scheme can't work if every State/U'I' has a different AUAand token number is generated separately by each of the state level AUAs.
