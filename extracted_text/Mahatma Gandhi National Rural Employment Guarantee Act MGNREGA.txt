Vision of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA
The vision of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA is to enhance the livelihood security of rural households across the country by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. Mahatma Gandhi NREGA recognizes the importance of strengthening the livelihood resource base of the poor by reaching the most vulnerable sections of rural areas, including Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, women-headed households, and other marginalized groups.
The scheme encourages a sense of community and collective responsibility by strengthening Panchayat Raj institutions. Mahatma Gandhi NREGA promotes a bottom-up approach to planning and execution, empowering local communities to take charge of their development. Through the creation of productive assets of prescribed quality and durability, the scheme addresses immediate economic needs while laying the foundation for long-term prosperity.
Mahatma Gandhi NREGA prioritizes sustainable development and environmental stewardship, striving to create a greener, more sustainable future for generations to come by prioritizing works that contribute to ecological conservation and rural infrastructure development. Central to the scheme's vision is a commitment to transparency and accountability, ensuring that funds are utilized efficiently and beneficiaries' rights are upheld through mechanisms such as social audits, grievance redressal, and proactive public disclosure.

Scheme Highlights
01
Employment Guarantee
MGNREGA provides a legal guarantee for 100 days of employment per year to every rural household in India. This ensures that eligible households have access to a minimum level of employment, helping alleviate poverty and providing a safety net during periods of economic distress.
02
Focus on Rural Development
The primary objective of MGNREGA is to enhance the livelihood security of rural households by promoting sustainable rural development. The program emphasizes the creation of productive assets such as water conservation structures, rural roads, and other infrastructure projects that contribute to the overall development of rural areas.
03
Inclusive and Demand-Driven
MGNREGA is designed to be demand-driven, meaning that employment opportunities are created in response to the expressed demand from the rural community. The beneficiaries have the right to demand work, and the government is obligated to provide employment within 15 days of such a demand.
04
Women's Participation
The act promotes the active participation of women in the workforce. One-third of the beneficiaries are women, and efforts are made to ensure that at least 50% of the workers are women. This not only contributes to women's empowerment but also addresses gender disparities in rural employment.
05
Transparency and Accountability
MGNREGA emphasizes transparency in the implementation of projects and financial transactions. Social audits are conducted to ensure accountability and enable local communities to actively participate in monitoring the implementation of projects. Information about the scheme, including work details, wages, and funds allocated, is made available to the public through various channels.
06
Electronic Fund Management
The use of technology is encouraged for efficient implementation and monitoring. Electronic Fund Management System (e-FMS) is employed to transfer wages directly to the bank accounts of the workers, reducing leakages and ensuring timely payments. This helps in minimizing corruption and improving the efficiency of the program.

ABPS
ABOUT Aadhaar Base Payment System (ABPS) in Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.
ABPS is a method of disbursing payments to MGNREGA workers using their unique 12-digit Aadhaar number as their financial address. All workers under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme are to receive their wages through an Aadhaar-based payment system (ABPS).
It had been decided to extend the mixed mode route of wage payment, either by ABPS (for ABPS enabled beneficiaries) or NACH (for those beneficiaries whose ABPS process is incomplete), till 31st December, 2023. Also it had been advised to state in mail and communicated many times that all the remaining beneficiaries, whose ABPS was pending for wage payment, should be brought into the ABPS platform by December, 2023.
The government passed the first order to impose ABPS on January 30, 2023. More extensions were given throughout the year time to time with the last one ending on December 31, 2023.
As of now, ABPS conversion is an automated process in Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. And 95.32% out of 13.18 Cr. of active workers are eligible for ABPS as on 16.10.2024 in Mahatma Gandhi NREGA.

Mission Amrit Sarovar
Mission Amrit Sarovar was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister on April 24th, 2022, with the objective of constructing or rejuvenating 75 Amrit Sarovars in every district nationwide in a concerted effort to conserve water for future generations. Under the Mission, the target was to complete 50,000 Amrit Sarovar by 15th August 2023. As on date, construction/rejuvenation of over 68,000 Amrit Sarovar has been completed. Out of all the completed Amrit Sarovars, around 25,000 Amrit Sarovars have been at the new sites while more than 45,000 Amrit Sarovars were rejuvenated under the Mission as Amrit Sarovar
All rural districts across the nation were covered under the Mission except the Union Territory of Delhi, Chandigarh, and Lakshadweep. Each Amrit Sarovar was to have a pondage area of a minimum of 1 acre (0.4 hectares) with a water holding capacity of about 10,000 cubic meters. However, in certain States like hilly States, North-Eastern States, and coastal States like Kerala this was not insisted upon due to topographical/ geographical constraints.
The Mission was implemented with a
“Whole of Government approach”
in all its aspects. The Mission was
executed through
the states and districts with the help of ongoing schemes namely, Mahatma Gandhi NREGS, 15th Finance Commission Grants, MKSY sub - schemes such as Watershed Development Component, Har Khet ko Pani, States’ scheme, and CSR funds.
For bringing transparency and effective monitoring, a dedicated Mission Amrit Sarovar Portal was created accessible through the link
https://amritsarovar.gov.in
which displays details of all the completed Amrit Sarovars along with photographs.
