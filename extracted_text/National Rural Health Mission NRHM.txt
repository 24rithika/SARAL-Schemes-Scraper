VISION
The National Health Policy, 2017 envisages- "the attainment of the highest possible level of health and wellbeing for all at all ages, through a preventive and promotive health care orientation in all developmental policies, and universal access to good quality health care services without anyone having to face financial hardship as a consequence".
The aim of NHM is to ensure progress towards the goals and targets set out in the National Health Policy, 2017 for ensuring "universal access to equitable, affordable and quality health care services, accountable and responsive to people's needs".
This would also enable the country to advance towards meeting Sustainable Development Goal3, i.e. "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages", including Universal Health Coverage.
